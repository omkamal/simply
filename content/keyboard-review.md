The Apex Pro Mechanical Keyboard is nothing short of a typing revelation. The moment my fingers glided across the effortlessly smooth keys, I knew I had stumbled upon keyboard nirvana. The customizable actuation points for each key is a game-changer, allowing for a tailored typing experience that's a cut above the rest. The RGB backlighting isn’t just a feast for the eyes, it’s practical and makes typing in dimly lit environments a breeze.
